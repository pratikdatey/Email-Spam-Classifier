# Email-Spam-Classifier

- PROBLEM STATEMENT

A tight competition between filtering methods and spammers is going on per day, as spammers began to use tricky methods to overcome the spam filters like using random sender addresses or appending random characters at the beginning
or end of mail's subject line. There is a lack of machine learning that focuses on the model development that can predict the activity. Spam is a waste of time to
the user since they have to sort the unwanted junk mail and it consumes storage space and communication bandwidth. Rules in other existing systems must be
constantly updated and maintained, making it more of a burden to some users and it is hard to manually compare the accuracy of classified data.
